# Orchestra
Orchestra is a visual language that compiles into RegExp (as for ECMAScript.) that tries to replace the existing syntax of Regular Expressions and tries to build upon that a better language so that developers can do more powerful stuff while having less pain.

### Orchestra Language
It's a truly new language that gives you all sorts of possibilities and features you want from a powerful regular expression system.

- __Readability__<br> The wildcard syntax of Regular Expression engines are very problematic when it comes to their readability. Orchestra solves this problem by introducing a new syntax that is visual and very readable and maintainable while still is fast to write.

- __Scalability__<br> Orchestra is capable of writing very large regular expressions. With that you can write scalable and maintainable regular expressions suited for doing large task. You can now use RegExps for task like data mining and so on...

- __Safe & Optimized Compilation__<br> Orchestra compiles to optimized and safe RegExp. Meaning you can use any character and if these characters be wildcard expressions it will take care of placing escapes for them. It let's you use any Unicode character and it will compile them to unicode escape sequences if your target RegExp engine can't understand unicode properly. 

- __Higher Level Language__ `Coming in Version 2`<br> Within the second release you can expect to have variables, functions, modules and libraries in Orchestra. It will truly change the face of regular expressions by giving you the tools to write really powerful pattern matching tools and with that should be expecting many new applications for regular expressions to be used in.

### Orchestra Studio
Orchestra Studio is the IDE for Orchestra Language. As Orchestra is a visual language it's IDE and Language Core are very much together and it's very hard for Orchestra Language to exists outside of the Orchestra Studio. Because of that we tried to make Orchestra Studio the best IDE for a developing regular expressions possible. It provides

- __Great Editor for Orchestra__<br>There really can't be any better IDE for Orchestra possible. It compiles Orchestra codes as you change it and when you select an Orchestra block it highlights the matching part in the compiled RegExps so that you can see what you're changes are.

- __Importing RegExps__<br>By using Kary Foundation's [Concerto Compiler](https://github.com/karyfoundation/concerto), Orchestra Studio is capable of importing any RegExp code and convert it to an optimized and greatly formatted Orchestra code. So you can import and edit any of your existing RegExps.

- __Great Debugging with Playgrounds__<br>Orchestra Studio let's you define a sample "testing text" in your Orchestra project and each time you change your Orchestra code you can instantly view how it executed on your sample text and what it did find there.

- __Best Documentations__<br> Orchestra comes with an offline documentation for Orchestra Language and is integrated right into the Orchestra Language. You can right click on any block at any point and it will open up its documentation.

- __RegExp Visualizations__ `Coming in Version 2`<br>Orchestra Studio visualizes your resulting RegExp sequence and let's you walk through the matching phases using [Regulex](https://jex.im/regulex/#!embed=false&flags=&re=%5E(a%7Cb)*%3F%24). If you use `Unsafe Wildcard` feature in your Orchestra's that is going to be the best way to see how you have changed your code.

- __Great IDE__<br> Orchestra is a beautiful IDE, it contains the perfection Kary Foundation software has. Beautiful UI and easy UX makes it easy to use and enjoyable to spend time in. It has night/light modes so you can work any time in the day and have fun. It also is fully cross-platform and you can have it on macOS, Linux and Window system
