# Orchestra
Orchestra is a visual language that compiles into RegExp (as for ECMAScript.). It's replacement for the existing syntax of Regular Expressions and tries to build upon that a better language so  developers can do more powerful stuff while having less pain.

### Orchestra Language
It's a truly new language that gives you all sorts of possibilities and features you want from a powerful regular expression system.

- __Readability__<br> The wildcard syntax of Regular Expression engines are very problematic when it comes to their readability. Orchestra solves this problem by introducing a new syntax that is visual, very readable and maintainable while still is fast to write.

- __Scalability__<br> Orchestra is capable of writing very large regular expressions. With that you can write scalable and maintainable regular expressions suited for doing large task. You can now use RegExps for task like data mining, parser writing and so on...

- __Safe & Optimized Compilation__<br> Orchestra compiles to optimized and safe RegExp. It takes care of escapes and Unicode text encodings. You can have things like Emojies in your phrases and it'll work!

- __Higher Level Language__ `Coming in Version 2`<br> Within the second release you can expect to have variables, functions, modules and libraries in Orchestra. It will truly change the face of regular expressions by giving you the tools to write really powerful RegExes. With that, you should be expecting many new applications for regular expressions to be used in.

### Orchestra Studio
Orchestra Studio is the IDE for Orchestra Language. As Orchestra is a visual language it's IDE and Language Core are very much together and it's very hard for Orchestra Language to exists outside of the Orchestra Studio. Because of that we tried to make Orchestra Studio the best IDE for developing regular expressions possible. It features:

- __Great Editor for Orchestra__<br>There really can't be any better IDE for Orchestra possible. It compiles Orchestra codes as you change edit and when you select an Orchestra block it highlights the matching part in the compiled RegExps so that you can see what you're changes are.

- __Importing RegExps__<br>By using Kary Foundation's [Concerto Compiler](https://github.com/karyfoundation/concerto), Orchestra Studio is capable of importing any RegExp code and convert it to an optimized and greatly formatted Orchestra code. So you can import and edit any of your existing RegExps.

- __Great Debugging with Playgrounds__<br>Orchestra Studio let's you define a sample "testing text" and many quick tests in your Orchestra project and each time you change your Orchestra code you can instantly view how it executed on your samples and what it did find there.

- __Best Documentations__<br> Orchestra comes with an offline documentation for Orchestra Language and is integrated right into the Orchestra Language. You can right click on any block and select 'help' to view the block's full documentation.

- __RegExp Visualizations__ `Coming in Version 2`<br>Orchestra Studio visualizes your resulting RegExp sequence and let's you walk through the matching phases using [Regulex](https://jex.im/regulex/#!embed=false&flags=&re=%5E(a%7Cb)*%3F%24). If you use `Unsafe Wildcard` feature in your Orchestra's that is going to be the best way to see how you have changed your code.

- __Great IDE__<br> Orchestra is a beautiful IDE. It contains the perfection that Kary Foundation software share. Beautiful UI and easy UX makes it easy-to-use and enjoyable to spend-time-in. It has night/light modes so you can work at any time in the day. It also is cross-platform and runs on macOS, Linux and Window systems.
