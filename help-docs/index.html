            <h2>Compose Block</h2>
            Compose is the main block where everything happens in it.
            You can't add or remove it, what you do must be placed inside the compose block, Quartet looks for blocks inside of the Compose Block. This also means that anything outside of the compose block is being ignored.

            Just as in a textual programming language where you can put text that has no effect on the behavior of the program, Comment Block in Quartet provides the same functionality.
