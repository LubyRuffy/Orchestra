            <h2>Compose Block</h2>
            Compose is the main block where everything happens in it.
            You can't add or remove it, what you do must be placed inside the compose block, Quartet looks for blocks inside of the Compose Block. This also means that anything outside of the compose block is being ignored.

    <!-- Comment Block -->

            <h2>Comment Block</h2>
            Just as in a textual programming language where you can put text that has no effect on the behavior of the program, Comment Block in Quartet provides the same functionality.

    <!-- One or more Block -->
    <div class="row">
        <div class="column text">
            <h2>"One or more" Block</h2>
            "One or more" block matches one or more than one sequence of letters following by each other.

            <h3>RegEx Equivalence</h3>
            "One or More" is the Kleene plus which means in the wildcard format you'd write it as <code>+</code>.

            <h3>Example</h3>
            The following Quartet compiles to wildcard <code>/a+/</code> and matches one or more of the letter <code>'a'</code> followed by each other. So <code>"a"</code>, <code>"aa"</code>, <code>"aaaaaa"</code> are all matched. In the string <code>"abaa"</code> however, It will match two substrings as <code>"a"</code> and <code>"aa"</code>.
